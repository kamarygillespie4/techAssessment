# Phoenix Capital Group Assessment

## Description

This project is a full-stack single-page application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to sign up for an account with their email and password, and then perform CRUD operations on Owners and Land Holdings. The application uses MongoDB for the database, and React for the frontend.

## Usage

1. Sign up with your email and password to create an account
2. Log in with your email and password to access the application
3. Use the navigation bar to access the Owners and Land Holdings pages
4. Click the "Create" button to create a new Owner or Land Holding
5. Click the "Edit" button to edit an existing Owner or Land Holding
6. Click the "Delete" button to delete an existing Owner or Land Holding (Note: deleting an Owner also deletes all related Land Holdings)
